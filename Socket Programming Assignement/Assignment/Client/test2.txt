We refer to the first five bytes of the record (comprising the ’MagicNo’, ’Type’ and
’FilenameLen’ fields) as the fixed header. The FileRequest record is being sent from
the client to the server. To receive and process a FileRequest record the server performs
the following steps:
• First the server attempts to read the five bytes of the fixed header into a byte array.
If that is not possible without gap (see below), then the server concludes that
the received FileRequest is erroneous and performs error processing as described
in Section 3.1 (i.e. printing an error message on the terminal, closing the socket
obtained from accept() and going back to the start of the loop). If this is possible,
then the server performs the following checks:
– The contents of the ’MagicNo’ field must equal 0x497E.
– The contents of the ’Type’ field must equal 1.
– The contents of the ’FilenameLen’ field must be at least one and must not be
larger than 1,024.
If any of these conditions is not true, then the server concludes that the received
FileRequest is erroneous and performs error processing.
• Then the server attempts to read exactly n further bytes from the FileRequest
record. These bytes are read into a byte array. If reading from the socket is not
possible without gap (see Section 3.4), then the server concludes that the received
FileRequest is erroneous and performs error processing as above. If the server
reads fewer than n bytes or more than n bytes, then again the server concludes
that processing failed and performs error processing.
